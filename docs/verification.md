# Scaffold verification

Verified during scaffold setup on October 15, 2026:

- Backend foundation checks: 2 passed (liveness and rejection of unknown plan fields).
- Frontend TypeScript check and Vite production build: passed.
- Installed npm dependency audit: 0 reported vulnerabilities at installation time.
- Live GET /api/health: returned scaffold liveness response.
- Same request through Vite proxy: passed.
- Docker Compose configuration: validated.
- Docker runtime: not verified because the daemon was not running.
- .env, .venv, node_modules and dist are ignored by Git.

No memory, graph queries, agents, authentication, or actions are implemented or
verified yet. The installed Starlette test client emits an httpx deprecation warning;
the current two foundation checks pass. Revisit the supported test-client dependency
when expanding HTTP tests. No model provider has been selected.
